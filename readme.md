# Caboodle   CDW110v Caboodle Data   Model Fundamentals



# Chapter 1 Introduction to Caboodle Data Model Fundamentals 

Welcome to Caboodle Data Model Fundamentals! This course introduces the basic tools, structures, and
concepts needed to understand and report on Caboodle data. You will learn the **organizational structure**
of the warehouse, key terms, and resources to help you better leverage Caboodle to write reports. You will
get a chance to explore and navigate the Caboodle portion of the **Cogito Data Dictionary** and apply what you learn
by writing and evaluating SQL queries against sample data.

Caboodle is a powerful analytics tool that can store custom data from Epic and non Epic sources. While
this course cannot predict every data point that will end up in your Caboodle database, it can familiarize
you with the data model and the accompanying documentation so that you can make the most out of
what Caboodle has to offer.
